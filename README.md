# nltk-cltk-notebooks

I keep these notebooks together because they all require Python 3 and it seemed like a bad idea to mix them with the PYthon 2 
notebooks in my Ovid repository.

I wouldn't recommend running the CLTK experiment in its current state because it will freeze up everything. But on that note,
this output-clearing utility is awesome: https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout. In fact, I should put it in my requirements...
